## Abstract
In Statistics, Estimation theory deals with the problem of making a decision about the value or values of unknown parameter or parameters of a population based on the information obtained from one or more sample/s. In this study, k independent Uniform populations are considered. The best population is selected based on a general class of selection rules. The scaled-squared loss function, the entropy loss function and the asymmetric loss function are considered in this study. Under these loss functions, various estimators of the scale parameter of the selected population are studied. A comparative study of risk values of the estimators are reported through simulation in this study. Finally, two seperate data are analyzed.
